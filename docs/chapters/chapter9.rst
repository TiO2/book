Company History
-------------------


In December 2014 the company signed an agreement with Opus Bio, Inc for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell product candidate targeting CD22.[3]

In April 2015 the company entered into a collaboration with MedImmune (a subsidiary of Astra Zeneca) investigating combination treatments for cancer. The trials will assess combinations of MEDI4736 and one of Juno's CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell candidates.[4] In May 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire Stage Cell Therapeutics for up to $223 million.[5] Later in the same month the company launched a collaboration, with Editas Medicine, to create CAR-T and high-affinity T cell receptor therapies to treat cancer, with the potential to generate up to $737 million-plus for Editas.[6] In June, the company announced it would acquire X-Body for more than $44 million.[7] In June, the company announced a 10-year partnership with Celgene valued at $1 billion.[8] As part of the deal Celgene will pay Juno $150 million and acquire 9.1 million new Juno shares (valued at $93, existing Juno shares rose 26% to $58.38). Celgene will gain the right to sell Junoâ€™s therapies around the world. This partnership surpasses the previous highest record when Pfizer agreed to a deal with Merck KGaA in 2014.[9]

In January 2016 Juno announced it had acquired AbVitro, allowing it to use next-generation single cell sequencing platforms to complement its ability to create T cells engineered to target a broad array of cancer targets.[10] Later in July of the same year, the company announced it would acquire RedoxTherapies for $10 million.[11] In August the company announced it would license rights from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Eureka Therapeutics for a novel, fully human binding domain targeting B-cell maturation antigen.
